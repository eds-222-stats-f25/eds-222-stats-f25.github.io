    "text": "Categorical data\nCategorical data fall into discrete categories. Examples include:\n\nLand cover type (e.g., forest, wetland, urban)\nEnergy source (e.g., solar, wind, natural gas, coal)\nAir pollutant (e.g., common, hazardous, particulate matter)\n\nWe usually summarize categorical data using counts and proportions. Here we’ll explore how to do so with tables and figures.\n\nContingency tables\nContingency tables summarize combinations of variables by frequency. Create one using the base R function table(). The table below reveals an important pattern not apparent using glimpse(): not all species of penguins were observed at all islands.\n\ntable(penguins$species, penguins$island)\n\n           \n            Biscoe Dream Torgersen\n  Adelie        44    56        52\n  Chinstrap      0    68         0\n  Gentoo       124     0         0\n\n\nThe tidyverse count() function will give you a contingency table in long format.\n\npenguins %&gt;% \n  count(species, island)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  species   island        n\n  &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie    Biscoe       44\n2 Adelie    Dream        56\n3 Adelie    Torgersen    52\n4 Chinstrap Dream        68\n5 Gentoo    Biscoe      124\n\n\nQ1 How would you pivot it to look like the contingency table above?\nWe often modify contingency tables in two ways.\nFirst, we often add marginal totals, i.e., the total of each row and column. The addmargins() function does that for us.\n\nspecies_island_table &lt;- table(penguins$species, penguins$island)\naddmargins(species_island_table)\n\n           \n            Biscoe Dream Torgersen Sum\n  Adelie        44    56        52 152\n  Chinstrap      0    68         0  68\n  Gentoo       124     0         0 124\n  Sum          168   124        52 344\n\n\nThese marginal totals demonstrate how counts can be difficult to compare, if they come from rows or columns with different totals. For example, more Adélie penguins were observed at Dream than Torgersen, but they represent a smaller fraction of the observations. Normalizing by proportion helps clarify that. You can calculate proportions either by row or column, for which we can use prop.table().\n\n# Row proportions\nprop.table(species_island_table, margin = 1)\n\n           \n               Biscoe     Dream Torgersen\n  Adelie    0.2894737 0.3684211 0.3421053\n  Chinstrap 0.0000000 1.0000000 0.0000000\n  Gentoo    1.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n\n# Column proportions\nprop.table(species_island_table, margin = 2)\n\n           \n               Biscoe     Dream Torgersen\n  Adelie    0.2619048 0.4516129 1.0000000\n  Chinstrap 0.0000000 0.5483871 0.0000000\n  Gentoo    0.7380952 0.0000000 0.0000000\n\n\nQ2 How would you use count(), group_by(), mutate(), and pivoting to create row- and column-wise proportion tables?\n\n\nBar plots\nBar plots are effective for visualizing counts and proportions of one or more categories.\nThis bar plot visualizes the counts of each species.\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(species)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ3 How would you use another aesthetic to show the composition of each species by island?\nQ4 Contrast the bar plot from Q3 with the contingency table from the beginning of the lab - how do they convey information differently?"

Mean and standard deviation are useful summaries, but be careful as they can hide important differences.\nThe mean is a measure of central tendency i.e., the expected or center value of an observation in the sample. The standard deviation is a measure of variation i.e., how spread out the sample is.\nAs a rule of thumb, about 68% of a sample’s data will fall within one standard deviation of the mean, and about 95% will fall within two standard deviations. The more “normally” distributed the data is (more on that tomorrow) the better these rules of thumb hold. Highly skewed data or data with a lot of outliers will deviate more from the rule of thumb.\nQ6 What percentage of penguin body masses fall within one standard deviation of the mean? Within two?\n\n\nScatterplots for paired data\nScatter plots depict relationships between variables.\n\npenguins %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm)) +\n  geom_point() \n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot above suggests little relationship between bill length and depth, or perhaps a slightly negative correlation. That means longer bills are not associated with deeper bills. However, if you ask a penguin anatomist, they’ll tell you the opposite is true: longer bills tend to be deeper, too. How can we reconcile these contrasting statements?\nThis is an example of Simpson’s paradox, which is when between-group correlations of one kind mask within-group correlations of another kind. Unmask the paradox by color-coding the points by species.\nQ7: Modify the scatterplot above to color-code the points by species. Then describe the correlations between bill depth, bill length, and species. How do the correlations across species mask the correlations within?"

Start thinking up a question and looking for data where the response variable has characteristics listed in the Model and response options table.

In this class, we will learn the statistical fundamentals that will enable us to draw conclusions about the environment and its interaction with social and economic systems. We will cover fundamental statistical concepts and tools, and then apply and expand upon those tools to learn some temporal and spatial statistical methods that are particularly helpful in environmental data science. Welcome!\n\nLearning objectives\nThe goal of this course is to enable MEDS students to confidently and competently apply statistical tools to socio-environmental datasets. Essential skills and concepts are:\n\nSummarize data numerically and graphically\nInterpret random variables\nSimulate data to test assumptions\nDescribe models using statistical notation\nDraw DAGs to clarify causal relationships\nQuantify uncertainty to perform inference"
