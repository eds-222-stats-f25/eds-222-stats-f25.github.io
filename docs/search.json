In this class, we will learn the statistical fundamentals that will enable us to draw conclusions about the environment and its interaction with social and economic systems. We will cover fundamental statistical concepts and tools, and then apply and expand upon those tools to learn some temporal and spatial statistical methods that are particularly helpful in environmental data science. Welcome!\n\nLearning objectives\nThe goal of this course is to enable MEDS students to confidently and competently apply statistical tools to socio-environmental datasets. Essential skills and concepts are:\n\nSummarize data numerically and graphically\nInterpret random variables\nSimulate data to test assumptions\nDescribe models using statistical notation\nDraw DAGs to clarify causal relationships\nQuantify uncertainty to perform inference"
