In your career as an environmental data scientist, you will often have to learn new analytic approaches to solve problems. The process of learning an unfamiliar statistical model is an important skill on its own. In this final project, you will use the skills you've developed in class to teach yourself a statistical model and apply it to an environmental dataset.

## Timeline

We're going to build up to the final project gradually over the whole quarter. These assignments are ungraded. Their purpose is to give you structure and get you instructor feedback early and often.

| Week | Assignment |
|----|----|
| 2 | Choose data and question |
| 3 | Exploratory analysis |
| 6 | Describe hypotheses with text and visuals |
| 8 | Describe model in statistical notation and fit model to simulated data |
| 9 | Fit model to real world data |
| 10 | First draft of blog post |

## Model and response options

The following list of models are suggestions for your final project together with the response characteristics they're designed for. You are allowed to choose a model not on this list if you're motivated to do so, but make sure to clear it with the instructors. The models are categorized by complexity level so you can choose a model aligned with your learning curve. You're encouraged to discuss options with the instructors!
